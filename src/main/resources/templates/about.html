                <p>
                    Alex Carter grew up in a small town where books were his world. He loved literature at an early age, 
                    inspired by authors like J. K. Rowling, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Tom Clancy. After studying English 
                    Literature, he created <strong>BookClub</strong>, a space where readers from across the globe 
                    could gather and express their passion for reading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With BookClub, Alex has built a community where members read books, interview authors, and share 
                    book recommendations. His mission is simple: to make reading a social and rewarding experience.
